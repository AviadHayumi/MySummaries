To understand it first we have to understand OSI Model.



first let's understand public & private ip address.

in the past in regular home there used to be only one device that connected to the Internet and what was in used is a modem.

but today in each house we have different of devices that have to be connected to the interested , this is actually works with the router.

all the devices connected to local network called to LAN (private network shared with router) and the router speaks with the external world.

if you have created beautiful node app , and you want to share it with the external world , you have to expose the port with the router.
